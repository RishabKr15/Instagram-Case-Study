# Relational-Database_Case-Study_Instagram
## Abstract
This is a case study project on Instagram, one of the most popular social media platforms worldwide. This project aims to explain the concept of schema design and the relationships between entities in relational databases. The case study involves a detailed product dissection of the Instagram platform. It covers a company overview of Instagram, real-world challenges related to social interaction, media sharing, and user engagement, and how Instagram addresses these challenges through innovative features. Based on Instagram's top features, a high-level schema design is developed, outlining the relationships between key entities. The project includes an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) that visualizes these relationships and concludes with insights gained through this analysis.

## Introduction
Instagram has transformed how users share media, connect with communities, and express themselves online. This project dives into Instagram's core functionalities and services, using that information to form a schema design and construct an Entity Relationship Diagram. These components are essential in building a robust relational database for any complex application.

## Problem Statement
* What challenges do users face when interacting and sharing content online, and how does Instagram overcome them?

* What is the schema design of Instagram based on the entities and relationships identified from its top features?

* How can we construct an ER Diagram to effectively represent the complexities of associations and constraints in Instagram’s relational database?

## Approach and Methodology

This case study is divided into the following major components:

**1. Company Overview**
This section provides a brief history of Instagram as a social platform and outlines its most important and widely used features, including photo/video sharing, stories, reels, messaging, and user engagement tools.

**2. Detailed Product Dissection**
This part covers key challenges faced by users and how Instagram has solved them through its features:

* Real-time content sharing

* Limited discoverability in older social platforms

* Lack of visual-first experiences

* Difficulty in managing social circles and privacy

* Limited tools for creators and influencers to monetize content

* Lack of cross-platform social integration

**3. Top Features**
Highlights of Instagram’s core features:

* User profiles

* Posts (photos, videos)

* Stories & Reels

* Likes, Comments, and Shares

* Followers and Following systems

* Direct Messaging

* Saved content and tagged users

**4. Schema Description**
This section presents a high-level schema design based on Instagram’s top features. The major entities identified include:

* User

* Post

* Comment

* Like

* Follower

* Story

* Message

* TaggedUser

This section also explains the relationships between these entities, such as:

* Users can create many posts.

* Posts can have many likes and comments.

* Users can follow other users.

* Users can send direct messages to each other.

* Users can tag others in posts and stories.

**5. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**

This diagram visualizes the relationships and attributes among the entities within the Instagram schema. It showcases how users interact with each feature and how those interactions are stored and related in a relational database.

**6. Conclusion** <br>
This section concludes the Instagram case study with insights into how schema design supports the functionality of complex platforms like Instagram.

**Contributions** <br>
The project was created using publicly available information on the Instagram platform, user interfaces, and functionality as seen on the mobile app and web version. The ERD was created using Lucidchart.

**Challenges** <br>
The main challenge was determining how to model social interactions such as likes, comments, follows, and messages efficiently in a relational schema. Analyzing feature interconnections helped in identifying the appropriate entities and defining their relationships.

## Conclusion
This case study on Instagram provides an in-depth understanding of how relational database concepts apply to a real-world social media platform. The product dissection helped identify user-facing challenges and how Instagram solves them through well-integrated features. A comprehensive schema and ERD were developed to model these solutions in the context of relational database design.
